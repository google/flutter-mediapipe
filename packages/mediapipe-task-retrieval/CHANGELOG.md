## 0.1.4

- Error messages and the README no longer refer to removed notes.

## 0.1.3

- The README has an installation section using `flutter pub add`.
- With `mediapipe_core` 0.1.3, downloads of models and native libraries wait out
  short network failures.

## 0.1.2

Release 0.1.2.

## 0.1.1

Adds Google's `NOTICE` at the package root.

## 0.1.0

The first release.

- Universal Embedder and Semantic Retriever on Android, iOS, macOS, Linux,
  Windows and the web, through Google's official MediaPipe runtimes: its
  per-family 1.2.0 retrieval C library natively and `@mediapipe/tasks-retrieval`
  in browsers.
- Universal Embedder and Semantic Retriever need 64-bit Android: 32-bit
  (armeabi-v7a) cannot hold their models, and their capability queries say
  so.
- `UniversalEmbedder` embeds text, encoded images and audio samples into one
  space, with `cosineSimilarity`; `SemanticRetriever` indexes documents,
  images, audio and mixed content with metadata and retrieves the nearest
  records, with the same results on every platform.
- `RetrievalModels` pins Google's EmbeddingGemma 2 models.
- Neither task is offered in WebKit, where Google's browser runtime returns
  zeros for every input with both models.
